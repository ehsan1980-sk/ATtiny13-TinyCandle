# Compiling and Uploading Firmware
## If using the Arduino IDE
- Make sure you have installed [MicroCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore).
- Go to **Tools -> Board -> MicroCore** and select **ATtiny13**.
- Go to **Tools** and choose the following board options:
  - **Clock:**  1.2 MHz internal osc.
  - **BOD:**    disabled
  - **Timing:** Micros disabled
- Connect your programmer to your PC and to the ICSP header on the board.
- Go to **Tools -> Programmer** and select your ISP programmer (e.g. [USBasp](https://aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=usbasp)).
- Go to **Tools -> Burn Bootloader** to burn the fuses.
- Open the TinyCandle sketch and click **Upload**.

## If using the precompiled hex-file
- Make sure you have installed [avrdude](https://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp/avrdude).
- Connect your programmer to your PC and to the ICSP header on the board.
- Open a terminal.
- Navigate to the folder with the hex-file.
- Execute the following command (if necessary replace "usbasp" with the programmer you use):
  ```
  avrdude -c usbasp -p t13 -U lfuse:w:0x2a:m -U hfuse:w:0xff:m -U flash:w:tinycandle.hex
  ```

## If using the makefile (Linux/Mac)
- Make sure you have installed [avr-gcc toolchain and avrdude](http://maxembedded.com/2015/06/setting-up-avr-gcc-toolchain-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/).
- Connect your programmer to your PC and to the ICSP header on the board.
- Open the makefile and change the programmer if you are not using usbasp.
- Open a terminal.
- Navigate to the folder with the makefile and the Arduino sketch.
- Run "make install" to compile, burn the fuses and upload the firmware.
